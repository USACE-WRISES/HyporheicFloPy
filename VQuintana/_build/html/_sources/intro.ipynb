    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hyporheic Project aims to automate the integration of surface water inputs into groundwater flow modeling using FloPy (ModFlow6) in Python. This project is designed to ease the difficulty and enhance the efficiency of groundwater modeling by streamlining the processing of surface water inputs from HEC-RAS, which is a widely-used software for simulating the hydraulics of water flow through natural rivers and other channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning the process of integrating surface water and groundwater modeling is often difficult and time-consuming. If these processes were easier to learn and run, we could incorporate groundwater more widely and quantify the ecological benefits of groundwater, specifically the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone is a critical area where groundwater and surface water interact, providing essential ecological functions such as nutrient cycling and habitat for aquatic organisms. By automating the inclusion of surface water inputs into groundwater models, this project aims to provide more reliable results for water resource management, environmental assessments, and hydrological studies while highlighting the importance of the hyporheic zone.\n",
